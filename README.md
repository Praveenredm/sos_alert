# SOS Application 🔴

This is a simple web-based SOS (emergency) notification system built using **HTML**, **Flask**, and **Twilio** API. The system allows a sender to trigger an emergency request (e.g., help with food), which sends an SMS notification to a predefined phone number. Once the issue is resolved, a follow-up message is sent automatically.
